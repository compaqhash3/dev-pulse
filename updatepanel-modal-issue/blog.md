ðŸš¨ ASP.NET WebForms + UpdatePanel + Bootstrap Modal = Chaos?

If youâ€™ve ever combined these two, youâ€™ve likely faced:

* Modal closes after partial postback ðŸ˜¤
* State/data doesnâ€™t persist ðŸ¤¯
* Controls inside UpdatePanels misbehave

I hit this exact wall recently. After experimenting, hereâ€™s the recipe that worked:
âœ… Keep modal HTML outside the UpdatePanel â€“ prevents re-rendering issues. 
âœ… Trigger modal manually after async postbacks:

ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(
this, this.GetType(),
"ShowModal",
"$('#myModal').modal('show');", true); 

âœ… Rebind behaviors inside UpdatePanels using PageRequestManager endRequest.

With these tweaks, modals + UpdatePanels now work seamlessly â€” paging, events, and updates are smooth ðŸŽ‰.
